# Binary Search Tree

Description: Tree data structure with ordered nodes for efficient searching.

Implementation:

- `insert(element)`, `delete(element)`
- `search(element)`
- `min()`, `max()`
- traversals: `in_order()`, `pre_order()`, `post_order()`

Implementation focus:

- Recursive and iterative implementations
- Balancing considerations (optional: implement basic balancing)

Relevant terms

- "Complete tree"
- "Balanced tree"
