# Advanced Graph Algorithms

Description: More complex graph operations and algorithms.

- `minimum_spanning_tree(graph)` (Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm)
- `shortest_path(graph, start, end)` (Dijkstra's algorithm)
- `all_pairs_shortest_path(graph)` (Floyd-Warshall algorithm)
- `topological_sort(graph)`
- `is_bipartite(graph)`

Implementation focus:

- Efficient implementation of classic graph algorithms
- Handling different graph representations (adjacency list/matrix)
